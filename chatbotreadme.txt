I deployed this very recently after training with very limited data. So it maynot repond well at the moment
But the more people use it, the more it learns!

2. Say a joke, whats your name, who r u?
3. tell about your technical skills
4. fav book
5. about my hobbies
6. show my your sample projects
7. gf name?
8. fav movie, fav song etc
9. sing a song!

I need your help in training this bot

How? 
-- Either you can just talk to the bot as much as you can, Ask it whatever you are intrested to know about me (Never mind the responses it gives)
-- Or you can connect with me and send me the questions!
-- If you noticed some issue, or have suggession about this website, you can also mention it through the chatbot! -eg: "Hey i found a bug, the image doesnt load" or "Hey anandhu, i noticed a spelling mistake.."
