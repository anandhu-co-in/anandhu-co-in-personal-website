My Personal Chatbot project
---------------------------

I deployed this very recently after training with very limited data. So it maynot repond well at the moment
But the more people use it, the more it learns!

I NEED YOUR HELP !
-----------------

I need your help in training this bot

How? 
-- Either you can just talk to the bot as much as you can, Ask it whatever you are intrested to know about me (Never mind the responses it gives)
-- As it as much varity of question as you can!
-- Or you can connect with me and send me the questions!
-- If you noticed some bug, or have suggession about this website, you can also mention it through the chatbot! -eg: "Hey i found a bug, the image doesnt load" or "Hey anandhu, i noticed a spelling mistake.."
